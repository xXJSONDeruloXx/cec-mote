`cec-mote` is a Decky Loader plugin for SteamOS that:

- sends HDMI-CEC volume commands through the built-in `cecd` D-Bus service
- assists with installing, repairing, verifying, and uninstalling services to sleep tv on system sleep, and turn on / change input of tv on system wake, specifically when paired with active DP to HDMI adaptors such as the UGREEN 8k DP to HDMI Adaptor. Additionally it auto discovers bluetooth dongles and enables them as bluetooth wake targets

The plugin does not talk to the CEC adapter directly. It uses `cecd` as the sole controller and sends only the validated high-level D-Bus methods exposed by `com.steampowered.CecDaemon1.CecDevice1`.
